## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
mtcars
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = hp)) +
  geom_point()
```
